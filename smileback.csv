negative,"Lost contacts, lost sent items, lost reminders, lost email sorted in categories, lost calendar.  I will probably need to go through my email to figure out my task list. Hope there was a better fix for this."

negative,YOU DIDN'T CALL ME BACK!
negative,"Calling me back on time. I had to call in after 4 hours to get a response. Otherwise, the service was friendly and helpful."

negative,i feel that this Request should have a time to know when IT is available to help coordinate my calendar.
negative,"In the end the issue was resolved and appropriately; however, I suggest proactively asking if a license should be purchased instead of waiting for the client to ask what the status was."
negative,This problem has been ongoing. Would like to have the problem fixed so that we are sure it won't keep happening.
negative,"Tried to download itunes. would not work. I chatted around the office and found a lot of people had the same issue. FYI when download of itunes is complete  click on item "" show file in folder"" , then right click on itunes download and select "" run as administrator""  this will then successfully open and run the wizard for install, which allows phone to connect with itunes.  i thought eddy was very positive and he tried to help, but make a note of this if anyone else is having itunes install and run problems."

positive,"Clint was so helpful and patient, it took 2 hours but he fixed it! Ususally SNS does not cll back when they said they will, I understand that a problem can take longer to fix with a customer and it's the same thing on our side, when SNS want to reschedule, we need flexibility because the lanned time didn't work. Also, he called me on my cell phone instead of the office number, the whole purpose on having a work laptop is to be able to work outside of the office and it was my case this morning and very very often. The flexibility to reach us on our cell phone makes all the difference. Thank you again Clint, I truly appreciate!"
